# YouTube MP3 Downloader
A Python GUI application to download videos or playlists from YouTube in mp3 format.
### If this doesn't work I'll try getting it fixed at some point
## Functionality

  - Includes a bitrate selector
  - Includes a text based queue for downloads
- YouTube Playlist to MP3
  - Will download single video links
  - Includes a bitrate selector
  - Includes a text based queue for downloads
- Video Download History Viewer

## Important
- This will initialize 2 ini files to store download file path and history. These files will appear in the same directory as the location the code was run

## Goal
Originally created as a way to mass install sound effects for video editing or audio composition without dealing with sketchy online YouTube Downloaders.
